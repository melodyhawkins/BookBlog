         <p class="storyintro">Hi! My name is Melody Hawkins and it is lovely to meet you. Welcome to my blog, based in my hometown of Fresno, California. 
           <p class="storybody">To start things off, you should know that I have loved reading for as long as I can remember. My childhood was filled with trips to the library, local bookstores, and of course the Scholastic Book Fair! Books have always been able to brighten my day. Whether I had a tough day at school or the firm, a new book and a pretty lipgloss could always make it better. For a while my books would just pile up on my shelves as I never could find the time to read them. Instead I would turn to magazines, which I still love to read. However, since retiring from being an attorney I have been able to return to my love of reading books and am enjoying every second of it. If there is a particular book that you would like me to read and review send me an email at <a href="https://www.gmail.com" target="_blank">ohthebooksshewillread@gmail.com</a> or message me on Instagram and I will do my best to satisfy your request. </p> 
          <p class="storybody">I hope that you will join me on my journey as I partake in the many adventures found in the land of books and share my love of reading. Oh the books I will read!
